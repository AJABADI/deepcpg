# DeepCpG examples

The following tutorials illustrate how to use DeepCpG for imputing and analysing single-cell methylation data. Tutorials are implemented as [IPython notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) and can hence be executed interactively.

Before execute tutorials, the `setup.sh` script must be run to setup the required dependencies:

```shell
bash setup.sh
```
